34) The Body Mass Index is a calculated value based on height and
a person's weight. According to the BMI value, we can classify the
individual within certain ranges.
 - below 18.5: Underweight
 - between 18.5 and 25: Ideal weight
 - between 25 and 30: Overweight
 - between 30 and 40: Obesity
 - over 40: morbid obesity

Note: BMI is calculated by the expressionBMI = current weight (kg)/heightÂ² (m) (weight divided by the square
height)
